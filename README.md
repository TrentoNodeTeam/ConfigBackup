#Configuration Backup Script v1.0

Created by TrentoNodeTeam (Trentino Network Srl)

In this section we will include the scripts to backup the configuration 
setting of the environment for each of the components (nova, cinder, neutron and so on). 

The scripts saves all the configurations of every component and also mysql status.
The files will be indexed with the date and time when executed and also the "older" backup files could be cancelled.
